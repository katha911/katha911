## About me
I am a positive-thinking person and feels excited about doing new things, ready to learn new things.

I graduated from University of Phayao with a degree in Software Engineering, from the Faculty of Information Technology and Communication.

Currently, I aim to apply my knowledge and analytical skills in software testing to seek new challenges in my professional endeavors.

I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience. It is a crucial step in my current career goal — to become a senior-level software qa in 2 years.
